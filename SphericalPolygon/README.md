SphericalPolygon
=====

Algorithm related to spherical polygon, used by another personal project on accelerating GPU ray-tracing. 

This projct includes:

* Constructing and storing spherical polygons. The polygons can be concave but must be simple (cannot have internal edges).
* Calculate the difference set of a polygon and a triangle as a list of polygons.
* Calculating the maximum inscribed circle of a polygon.
