ReciprocalFibonacci
=======

Given an accuracy, calculation of the [reciprocal fibonacci constant (Ïˆ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_Fibonacci_constant). 
Algorithms here can handle very big input using BigInteger struct. The number is calculated digit by digit so you 
can run it with a very large input and stop at any where you want.
